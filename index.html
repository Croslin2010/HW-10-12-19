<li>Something I didn't understand but now do from class is Objects vs Arrays.  At first I didn't understand the difference between them bu then I looked at arrays as lists of things and objects as boxes of things.  To retrieve something from a list you need its place but to get an item from a box you need it's name.</li>
<li>Something I feel I still don't fully understand is CSS and this mainly comes down to how it is called and what calling it actually does.  I feel like in order to clear this up I will just need o read over it again.</li>
